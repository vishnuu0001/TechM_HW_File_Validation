## ⏱️ What Happens Next (Automatic)

1. **GitHub receives push** (~30 sec)
   - Your commit appears on GitHub

2. **Vercel detects changes** (~1 min)
   - Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Should see "Building..."

3. **Build process starts** (~3-5 min)
   - Installs dependencies (Flask, pandas, openpyxl, numpy)
   - Builds React frontend
   - Deploys Flask API

4. **Deployment completes**
   - Status shows "Ready"
   - Your app is live at: https://your-domain.vercel.app

## ✅ Verify Deployment Worked

### In Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Latest deployment should show "Ready" (green checkmark)
5. Click it to view logs

### In Your App
1. Open: https://your-domain.vercel.app/
2. Upload an Excel file
3. **Should NOT get 405 error anymore!**

## 🆘 If Deployment Fails

### Check Vercel Logs
1. Dashboard → Deployments → Latest
2. Click "View Logs"
3. Look for errors

### Common Issues
- **"Flask not found"** → Check requirements.txt has Flask ✓

- **"405 error persists"** → Vercel cache, try "Redeploy"

### Force Redeploy
1. Dashboard → Settings
2. Scroll to "Advanced"
3. Click "Redeploy" → Confirm

   If error, install Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win

2. **Use GitHub Desktop instead:**
   - Download: https://desktop.github.com/
   - Open your repo
   - Commit → Publish (same effect as git push)

3. **Verify files locally:**
   ```bash
   python verify_deployment.py
   ```
   Should show 15/15 checks ✓

4. **Check Vercel is linked:**
   - vercel.json exists? ✓
   - Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard/settings/tokens

## BOTTOM LINE

Your code is ready. You just need to **push it to GitHub** so Vercel can deploy the Flask version.

**Once pushed, the 405 error will be GONE in about 5-10 minutes.**

🚀 Go deploy!
