# 🚀 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FINAL ACTION REQUIRED

## THE ISSUE

You're still getting **405 errors** because:
- ✅ Code fixes are done locally
- ❌ Changes haven't been pushed to GitHub yet
- ❌ Vercel is still running the old code

## THE SOLUTION

Push your code changes to GitHub. Vercel will automatically rebuild with the Flask fix.
